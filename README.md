# Welcome to Xenox

Xenox is one of my High School projects created in python with the help of KivyMD and MySQL.


## What can it do?

Xenos is a stock and store management software to help companies to stay up to date with all the information.
- Profile - check user data and change password (account management)
- Suppliers - Fundamental suppliers information (CRUD data)
- Products - in-store stock (CRUD data)
- Employees -  employee information (contacts, positions, work place, section...) (CRUD only for administrators). Each employee has his own permissions from his role.
- Sections - section information (basic information and location) (CRUD only for administrators and section chiefs)
- Shipments - only reading data (data is generated automatically when buying from the supplier)


## Connection warnings and data verification

If the database is unavailable or the account that the user is trying to log in is deactivated, a warning pops up.
